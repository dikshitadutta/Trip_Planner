The current travel form needs changes.Remove the departing from part completely...just keep the search destination input field, also remive the Activity preference and in the next part when I click continue remove the type of field selection entirely for now(instead I would prefer an optional invite teammate button through email) also need improvement in the date selection calender design. I want to be able to select the start date and the end date in the same calender...
